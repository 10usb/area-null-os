# AreaNull OS
This is my "too many" attempt at writing an OS. It's just a hobby OS attempting to get to get a 32 bit graphical interface up-and-runnnig.

## Why the name AreaNull
After revisiting my last attempt, and deciding to start fresh instead of continuing on a 10 year old codebase. I didn't like these old name but could think of one, and just wanted to start on building "an OS". And some side thoughts we're trying to think what could the abbreviation an could stand for and AreaNull popped in my mind. My main thought considered it for a second, and thought that will do. And the first step creating a folder with this name was made.
